  <h2>
    To Do List:
  </h2>
  
  <ul>
    <li>There is currently no automatic way to update records and I am working on finding an API to implement that functionality</li>
    <li>The application is currently just a command line interface, I would like to have a web interface or have some GUI</li>
    <li>I need to create documentation for the project and outline detailed functionality</li>
    <li>I have not edited any values in a while but I will be updating values for the upcoming season and tracking how the program predicts the playoff bracket will work throughout the 2017-2018 season and look at the accuracy there.</li>
    <li>I will be making tweaks to the algorithm based on accuracy of projections on previous seasons.</li>
    <li>Any changes from this point on will be documented, I will consider the software as of 3/21/17 version 1.0.0 and move on from there. Once I can get documentation for the changes made in the past I wil renumber the changes and have a copy of the current system in a seperate file for cross referencing.</li>
  </ul>
