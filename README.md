VS-22C-GP


=========


- Program produces a NFL (can be adaptable to other sports as well) playoff bracket
- Allows for a "what-if" situation with to change a team's record and see how it might play out if a 
given team has a user defined record instead of the records in the program

This project was part of my CIS 22C class at De Anza college, this was a class in data structures in C++. The project itself was a team effort (the commit history will show that) but I had put a substantial amount of work into the project and will be taking ownership and updating the project from here.

There was no detailed changelog besides commit history which was not the best at times but I am working on documentation for the program

==========


To Do List


===========
+ There is currently no automatic way to update records and I am working on finding an API to implement that functionality
+ The application is currently just a command line interface, I would like to have a web interface or have some GUI
+ I need to create documentation for the project and outline detailed functionality
+ I have not edited any values in a while but I will be updating values for the upcoming season and tracking how the program predicts the playoff bracket will work throughout the 2017-2018 season and look at the accuracy there.
+ I will be making tweaks to the algorithm based on accuracy of projections on previous seasons.
+ Any changes from this point on will be documented, I will consider the software as of 3/21/17 version 1.0.0 and move on from there. Once I can get documentation for the changes made in the past I wil renumber the changes and have a copy of the current system in a seperate file for cross referencing.
