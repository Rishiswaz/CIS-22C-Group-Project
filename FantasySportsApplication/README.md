CIS 22C
======

Some basic outline of what the project could look like.

I got lazy making this so the little implementation that is there is in the header file.

Start with main.cpp then checkout Player.h and QB.h, from there PlayerBucket.h then finally Team.h

Has polymorphism and 3 algorithims, if we break it up should be pretty easy to implement.
