It doesn't pick for you, if just suggests so if you don't like the pick, just say you don't want that player and it will spit out another.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nTeam2:\r\n\r\nRishabh Bajpai(@rishiswaz)\r\n\r\nSaagar Patel\r\n\r\nDennis Berko (@dennisberko)\r\n\r\nChris Torrecampo\r\n\r\nKairui Man\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
